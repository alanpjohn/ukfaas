# ukfaas - Serverless Framework for Unikernels

ukfaas is a serverless framework designed to facilitate the use of Unikraft unikernels packaged as OCI (Open Container Initiative) images in serverless computing environments. This project aims to promote and incorporate unikernels into serverless computing, offering the advantages of reduced overhead and enhanced security. ukfaas achieves this by implementing the openfaas-provider interface and integrating seamlessly with all OpenFaaS tooling.

## Why ukfaas?

ukfaas bridges the gap between serverless computing and unikernels, providing a simple and efficient way to run unikernels as serverless functions. By adopting ukfaas, you can harness the benefits of unikernels, such as minimal resource consumption and rapid boot times, in your serverless applications.


## RoadMap

The project was initially built towards the completion of my dissertation project as a proof concept. The codebase requires some work and will have to grow alongside the unikraft project as that reaches maturity.
